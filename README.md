Background
--------------

This was designed as a tutorial for Ian Misner's R course in order to demonstrate how to plot whole genome information, such as Fst, Dxy or any other statistic, in R.

The sample files here are downsampled and they are intended for tutorial use only. 

### Getting started

You will may have a BED file, IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer: https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) file or a different type of file. This tutorial is designed to work with IGV files, but it can be modified by tweaking the code to work on BED files or other files formats.

First, download the file titled: O_niloticus_males_vs_females.downsampled.fst.igv

This is a downsampled file that was used in Gammerdinger et al., 2014.
